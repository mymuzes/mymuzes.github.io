<h1>My first SVG</h1>
<!-- An SVG image begins with an <svg> element
The width and height attributes of the <svg> element define the width and height of the SVG image
The <circle> element is used to draw a circle
The cx and cy attributes define the x and y coordinates of the center of the circle. If cx and cy are not set, the circle's center is set to (0, 0)
The r attribute defines the radius of the circle
The stroke and stroke-width attributes control how the outline of a shape appears. We set the outline of the circle to a 4px green "border"
The fill attribute refers to the color inside the circle. We set the fill color to yellow
The closing </svg> tag closes the SVG image

Note: Since SVG is written in XML, all elements must be properly closed! -->

<svg width="100" height="100">
   <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
